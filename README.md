# 🎮 Memory Card Game – With a Jumpscare Twist! 👻

Welcome to my memory card game!  
It looks fun and simple at first… but **if you run out of time, you'll get a jumpscare** 😱  
This game was built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💡 What the Game Does

- Flip two cards at a time to try and find a match.
- Match all 8 pairs **before the timer runs out** (60 seconds by default).
- If you win — great! 🎉  
- If you lose — a **jumpscare video** pops up right in the center of the screen. 😨

---

## 🎬 Jumpscare Video

- The video plays **automatically** when time is up.
- It appears **in the center** of the screen, like a popup.
- It disappears when you press the **Reset** button.

> ⚠️ This is a real jumpscare — please use with caution if you're showing this to others!

## 🔊 Sound Effects

Each action has its own sound:
- Card flip sound
- Match sound
- Mismatch sound
- Win cheer
- Lose sound
- Plus the video includes scary audio 😬

## 🌗 Dark Mode

You can switch between light and dark themes using the 🌙 / ☀ button in the corner.  
Everything changes: the background, cards, buttons — even during the scare!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Click two cards to flip them.
2. If they match, they stay flipped.
3. If not, they flip back after 1 second.
4. Try to match all pairs before time runs out!
5. **Run out of time?** Jumpscare. Game over. 👻
